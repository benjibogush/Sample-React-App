        Early in my middleschool years, I often thought of the world as a place for eternity and sametime around, I ended up losing many loved ones and I changed my mind about what I will do if I survive the next 20 - 30 years! And yes, here I am. I set out to wilderness or some might call it a city life! There I met with several people whom shared many different backgrounds. As I have grown up, I slowly and painfully lost lots of friendships and close friends. Some left me because I never sided with politics, and some scrutinized me for what I believe!
